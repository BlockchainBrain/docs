Create a MN1 Wallet Address and send it the required burn coins
---------------------------------------------------------------

.. _createmnaddressexisting:

1. Create a receiving address for the MasterNode collateral funds.

	* Go to **File -> Receiving addresses**
	* Click **New**, type in a label and press **Ok**.
	* Select the row of the newly added address and click **Copy** to store the destination address in the clipboard.
	* You can name the wallet with a description such as "**MN1**" by right clicking it and selecting **Edit**.
	
.. _sendburncoins_updateexisting:

2. Send **EXACTLY 20000 RUPX** coins to the MN1 wallet address. Double check you've got the correct address before transferring the funds.

	After sending, you can verify the balance in the Transactions tab. This can take **a few minutes** to be confirmed by the network. Go get a glass of water. No alcoholic beverages please, we are not out of the woods yet.

.. warning::	If you are sending from an exchange, make sure you account for the withdrawal fee so that you get EXACTLY EXACTLY EXACTLY 20000 RUPX in the new wallet address. This is a common error that will cause the next step to not give you the transaction id that is needed. For example, to withdraw from `Stocks.Exchange` the correct ammount for a MasterNode, you need to specify the ammount of **20000.001** to account for the fee.

Output your MN TXhash and Outputidx and update the MasterNode configuration file
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. _opendebugconsole_updateexisting:

3. Open the Debug console of the wallet in order to type a few commands. 

	Go to **Tools -> Debug console**

.. _outputtxhash_updateexisting:

4. Run the **masternode outputs** command to retrieve the transaction ID of the collateral transfer::

	masternode outputs
	
* You should see an output that looks like this in the Debug console:
   
	'"txhash" : "c19972e47d2a77d3ff23c2dbd8b2b204f9a64a46fed0608ce57cf76ba9216487",'
	'"outputidx" : 1'

* **NOTE: If you do not get output resembling the above example then you likely do not have EXACTLY 20000 RUPX in the MN1 wallet address.  You will need to resolve this issue and ensure that ONLY and EXACTLY 20000 RUPX is in the MN1 address and that it is in a single input.**

.. _copysavetxhash_updateexisting:

5. Copy and save the `txhash` and `outputidx`.  Both the `txhash` and `outputidx` will be used in the next step. The `outputidx` will be either a `0` or `1`, both are valid values.

.. _masternodeconf_updateexisting:

6. Go to `Tools` -> `Open MasterNode Configuration File` and add a line in the newly opened `masternode.conf` file.  If you get prompted to choose a program, select a text editor like Notepad/TextEdit to open it.
	
* These are the default directories for Rupaya:
	+------------------------------------------------+
	|* Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/RupayaCore |
	|* Windows: ~/AppData/Roaming/RupayaCore         |
	+------------------------------------------------+
* Below is an example of what you need in the `masternode.conf` file, all on a single line with no carriage returns.  The file contains an example that is commented out(with a **#** symbol in front). Read it for reference. Based on the output example from the **masternode outputs** command, you would add this line in::

	MN1 199.247.10.25:9050 87LBTcfgkepEddWNFrJcut76rFp9wQG6rgbqPhqHWGvy13A9hJK c19972e47d2a77d3ff23c2dbd8b2b204f9a64a46fed0608ce57cf76ba9216487 1

* **MN1** is the node's alias. 
* **199.247.10.25** is the external IP of the masternode server that will provide services to the network. 
* **87LBTcfgkepEddWNFrJcut76rFp9wQG6rgbqPhqHWGvy13A9hJK** is your masternode private key (aka GenKey), which is the value used for `masternodeprivkey=` in **/root/.rupayacore/rupaya.conf**. 
* **c19972e47d2a77d3ff23c2dbd8b2b204f9a64a46fed0608ce57cf76ba9216487** is your TXhash from `masternode outputs`. 
* **1** is your 'outputidx' (aka Index) from `masternode outputs`.

.. _restartcoldwallet_updateexisting:

7. Restart the Cold wallet to pick up the `masternode.conf` changes.

.. _listconf_updateexisting:

8. Open the Debug console (Open **Tools > Debug console**) and run the command **masternode list-conf**::

	masternode list-conf

* Verify that the output matches what you entered in the `masternode.conf` file.

.. _masternodetab_updateexisting:
	
9. Go to the 'Masternodes' tab and check if your newly added masternode is listed.

	You should now see the newly added MasterNode with a status of `MISSING`.
	If you want to control multiple MasterNode Hot wallets from this Cold wallet, you will need to repeat steps 1-7. The `masternode.conf` file will contain an entry for each masternode that will be added to the network.
 

Start the MN from the Cold Wallet
------------------------------------

.. warning:: It is very important that you let the MasterNode Hot wallet synchronize for a couple of hours prior to starting it from the Cold wallet.  If you attempt to start it before it isfully synchronized then it will fail.  Both the Cold and Hot wallets need to be on same version/protocol to activate the MasterNode.

**NOTE:** If you can update and restart your MasterNode within 1 hour, then it won't require a restart and shoudl stay enabled. However, if you are updating to a wallet with a different protocol then you must re-activate your node from the Cold Wallet regardless of whether you did the migration in less than one hour.

.. _startmasternode_updateexisting:

1. There are three ways that you can start the MasterNode from the Cold Wallet.  Below are the three options to register the MasterNode.
	
	* Option 1. Open the Masternodes tab, select the MasterNode that you want to start, and click the button **Start alias**
	* Option 2. Open the Masternodes tab and click the button **Start all**
	* Option 3. Open the Cold wallet Debug console and run the following command::
	
	startmasternode alias false MN1

* In the example above, the alias of my MasterNode was MN1. In your case, it might be different and is based on what you entered as the first word in the masternode.conf file.
* You should get multiple lines of output.  If one of the lines of output says **"result" : successful"** then you can proceed to the next step to verify the MasterNode started correctly on the VPS Hot wallet.  If you did not get the **successful** output then there is likely an issue with the masternode.conf file that needs to be resolved first.

.. warning:: Every time you start the MN, from the Cold Wallet, it starts the queue cycle over again.  The queue cycle currently takes up to 36 hours for you to get a payout.  DO NOT USE THIS COMMAND IF YOUR SYSTEM IS ALREADY STARTED OR IT WILL CAUSE YOU TO LOSE YOUR PLACE IN THE QUEUE CYCLE AND THE 36 HOUR WAIT WILL START OVER AGAIN.
	
**If you received the output that shows the MasterNode started successfully then you can proceed to the next step to verify that your MasterNode started correctly from the VPS Hot wallet.**
