Cold Wallet Setup
=================

These instructions are intended for those that are installing the new Rupaya Core 5 wallet on your personal Windows or Mac computer.  The Cold wallet is where the MasterNode collateral will be locked.  After the setup is complete, this wallet will be the one receiving the MasterNode rewards.  This wallet will not have to run 24/7, once the setup is complete.

Requirements:
--------------
	```Windows 7 or higher, Mac OS, or Linux
	Outgoing internet access to sync the blockchain and enable the MasterNode remotely```

Install the Rupaya Cold Wallet
------------------------------

1. Open the following URL in a web browser to download the appropriate wallet version for your system:

	* https://github.com/rupaya-project/rupx/releases

.. warning:: Do not install the new wallet on the computer that contains an existing Rupaya wallet that is currently holding RUPX coins.  You will need to either install the new wallet on a different computer or move your coins to a different computers' wallet, prior to installing the new wallet.  This is to prevent any chance that the new wallet will overwrite your current wallet and cause you to lose your coins.

.. _backupwalletandkeys_coldwallet:

2. Be sure that your existing wallet.dat and private keys are backed up from the old wallet.  We strongly recommend backing up your wallet.dat and private keys prior to starting this process.

	For more instructions, watch this Video_ from a fellow Rupayan, David Coen, on how to export your private keys:

.. _renameolddirectory_coldwallet:

3. Rename the old Rupaya directory to something like **rupaya4**. This will prevent the new wallet install from conflicting with any of the existing data.  This is only required if the computer contains the old Rupaya wallet:

	* Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/Rupaya
	* Windows: ~/AppData/Roaming/Rupaya

* NOTE: If you are confident that you no longer need this old data then you can just delete the old rupaya directory instead of renaming it.

.. warning:: Do not delete the current wallet directory if the existing wallet still has coins in it.  You should be doing this install on a computer that does not currently have a Rupaya wallet that contains coins.
	
.. _unzipwallet_coldwallet:
	
4. Unzip the wallet files and move the Rupaya-cli and Rupaya-qt files onto the Desktop or Application folder.  

	* If prompted, confirm that you want to replace the existing file(s).

.. _installwallet_coldwallet:

5.Double click the Rupaya-qt file to open and install the new wallet.

	* If you are prompted to use a data directory then select the radio button next to **Use the default data directory** and click **OK**
	* Accept any pop ups asking to confirm if you want to continue with the installation
	* When prompted, select **Use the default data directory** and click **OK**
	* If prompted by security or antivirus software, click **Allow Always**
	* The new wallet should now open and begin to synchronize with the network

.. _createmnaddressbasic_coldwallet:

Create a MN1 Wallet Address and Send it the 20000 Collateral Coins
------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Create a receiving address named MN1.  This wallet address will be used for the MasterNode collateral funds.

	* Go to **File -> Receiving addresses**
	* Click **New**, type in a label and press **Ok**.
	* Select the row of the newly added address and click **Copy** to store the destination address in the clipboard.
	* You can name the wallet with a description such as "**MN1**" by right clicking it and selecting "Edit".

.. _sendburncoinsbasic_coldwallet:

2. Send **EXACTLY 20000 RUPX** coins to the MN1 address. Double check you've got the correct address before transferring the funds.

	* After sending, you can verify the balance in the Transactions tab. This can take **a few minutes** to be confirmed by the network. Go get a glass of water. No alcoholic beverages please, we are not out of the woods yet.

.. warning::	If you are sending from an exchange, make sure you account for the withdrawal fee so that you get EXACTLY EXACTLY EXACTLY 20000 RUPX in the new wallet address. This is a common error that will cause the next step to not give you the transaction id that is needed. For example, to withdraw from `Stocks.Exchange` the correct ammount for a MasterNode, you need to specify the ammount of **20000.001** to account for the fee.

Output your MN TXhash and Outputidx and update the MasterNode configuration file
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. _opendebugconsolebasic_coldwallet:

1. Open the Debug console.

	Go to **Tools -> Debug console**

.. _outputtxhashbasic_coldwallet:

2. Run the **masternode outputs** command to retrieve the transaction ID of the new MN1 wallet that contains the 20000 RUPX collateral::

	masternode outputs 
	
* You should see an output that looks like this in the Debug console:
   
	'"txhash" : "c19972e47d2a77d3ff23c2dbd8b2b204f9a64a46fed0608ce57cf76ba9216487",'
	'"outputidx" : 1'

**NOTE: If you do not get output resembling the above example then you likely do not have EXACTLY 20000 RUPX in the MN1 wallet address.  You will need to resolve this issue and ensure that ONLY and EXACTLY 20000 RUPX is in the MN1 address and that it is in a single input.**

.. _copysavetxhashbasic_coldwallet:

3. Copy and save the **txhash** and **outputidx**.  

	* Both the **txhash** and **outputidx** will be used in the next step. 
	* The **outputidx** will be either a **0** or **1**, both are valid values.

.. _masternodeconfbasic_coldwallet:

4. Go to **Tools** -> **Open Masternode Configuration File** to open the **masternode.conf** file.  

	* If you get prompted to choose a program, select a text editor like Notepad/TextEdit to open it.
	* These are the default directories for the Rupaya data directory where this file is stored:
	
		* Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/Rupayacore
		* Windows: ~/AppData/Roaming/Rupayacore

5. Copy the following template and paste it into the **masternode.conf** file, on a new line::

	MN1 <public_mn_ip_address_here>:9050 <your_masternode_genkey_output> <collateral_output_txid> <collateral_output_index>
	
6. Update the **masternode.conf** file variables as instructed below.

* Leave **MN1** as is.  This is the node's alias and will be used in the Cold wallet Debug Console to enable the MasterNode.
* Replace the variable **<public_mn_ip_address_here>** with your Linux VPS IP address.
* Leave **:9050** as is and ensure that there are no spaces between the IP address and the port.  This is the TCP port that the Rupaya wallet uses.
* Replace the variable **<your_masternode_genkey_output>** with your masternode private key (aka GenKey) that you received as output from the **rupaya-cli masternode genkey** command on the Linux VPS. 
* Replace the variable **<collateral_output_txid>** with the **txhash** that you received as output from the **masternode outputs** command in the Cold wallet Debug Console.
* Replace the variable **<collateral_output_index>** with the **outputidx** that you received as output from the **masternode outputs** command in the Cold wallet Debug Console.
* **NOTE:** Below is an example of what the newly added line will look like once you have updated it will all of the required information. All of the information should be contained in a single line with no carriage returns::

	MN1 199.247.10.25:9050 87LBTcfgkepEddWNFrJcut76rFp9wQG6rgbqPhqHWGvy13A9hJK c19972e47d2a77d3ff23c2dbd8b2b204f9a64a46fed0608ce57cf76ba9216487 1

.. _restartcoldwalletbasic_coldwallet:

7. Restart the Cold wallet to pick up the changes to the **masternode.conf** file.

.. _listconfbasic_coldwallet:

Verify the Masternode.conf File is Configure Correctly
------------------------------------------------------

1. Open the Debug console and run the command **masternode list-conf**::

	masternode list-conf

* Verify that the output matches what you entered in the **masternode.conf** file.

.. _masternodetabbasic_coldwallet:
	
2. Go to the Masternodes tab and verify that the newly added MasterNode is listed.

	* You should now see the newly added MasterNode with a status of **MISSING**.
	
* NOTE: If you want to control multiple MasterNode Hot wallets from this Cold wallet, you will need to repeat the previous steps to create a new MN wallet address, send it the 20000 collateral coins, and update the masternode.conf file. The **masternode.conf** file requires an entry for each MasterNode that you will be managing with this Cold wallet.
 

Starting the MN from the Cold Wallet
------------------------------------

.. warning:: It is very important that you let the MasterNode Hot wallet synchronize for a couple of hours prior to starting it from the Cold wallet.  If you attempt to start it before it is fully synchronized then it will fail.

.. _startmasternode_updateexisting:

1. There are three ways that you can start the MasterNode from the Cold Wallet.  Below are the three options to register the MasterNode.
	
Option 1. Open the Masternodes tab, select the MasterNode that you want to start, and click the button **Start alias**

Option 2. Open the Masternodes tab and click the button **Start all**

Option 3. Open the Cold wallet Debug console and run the following command::

	startmasternode alias false MN1

* In the example above, the alias of my MasterNode was MN1. In your case, it might be different and is based on what you entered as the first word in the masternode.conf file.
* You should get multiple lines of output.  If one of the lines of output says **"result" : successful"** then you can proceed to the next step to verify the MasterNode started correctly on the VPS Hot wallet.  If you did not get the **successful** output then there is likely an issue with the masternode.conf file that needs to be resolved first.

.. warning:: Every time you start the MN, from the Cold Wallet, it starts the queue cycle over again.  The queue cycle currently takes up to 36 hours for you to get a payout.  DO NOT USE THIS COMMAND IF YOUR SYSTEM IS ALREADY STARTED OR IT WILL CAUSE YOU TO LOSE YOUR PLACE IN THE QUEUE CYCLE AND THE 36 HOUR WAIT WILL START OVER AGAIN.

	
**If you received the output that shows the MasterNode started successfully then you can proceed to the next step to verify that your MasterNode started correctly from the VPS Hot wallet.**
