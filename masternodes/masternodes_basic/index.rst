These instructions are intended for users that want to setup a MasterNode on a Linux VPS and a Cold wallet on a PC or Mac computer.  

If you are an advanced user and would like to skip some of the explanations that are provided in the Basic Setup Guide, then I recommend using the :ref:`Advanced Setup Guide<masternodes_advanced>`.

If you would like to use a bash script to automate the installation of the Rupaya Wallet on the Linux VPS, then I recommend using the :ref:`Scripted MasterNode Setup Guide<masternodes_scripted>`.
