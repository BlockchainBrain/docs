===============
What is Rupaya?
===============


Rupaya aims to be the most user-friendly and scalable payments-focused cryptocurrency in the world. The Rupaya network features instant transaction confirmation, double spend protection, anonymity equal to that of physical cash, a self-governing, self-funding model driven by incentivized full nodes and a clear roadmap for on-chain scaling to up to 400MB blocks using custom-developed open source hardware. While Rupaya is based on Bitcoin and compatible with many key components of the Bitcoin ecosystem, its two-tier network structure offers significant improvements in transaction speed, anonymity and governance. This section of the documentation describes these and many more key features that set Rupaya apart in the blockchain economy.
